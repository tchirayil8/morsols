                        We have the Morsol to deliver the gifts of hemp, sun, and good soil to you for your enjoyment. There is so much more to hemp than that which "gets you high". You can rest easy knowing our broad spectrum hemp oil is derived from sustainably farmed hemp and the remainder of the plant can be used in many other industries.

                        We believe that outdoor grown, minimally processed hemp is the most wholesome. We have the test results, but only you can be the judge of what goodness feels like.

                        Processing:<br />
                        Raw hemp material is extracted woth CO2, retaining the delicate terpenes and flavonoids and leaving behind zero solvent. This is the same extraction method used in the decaffenation process for tea and coffee. The oil is then distilled and separated via column chromatography to ensure hemp compliance, an oil free of hard-to-dgiest waxes, and to maximize consumer benefits via adjusting natural ratios of cannabinoids.
